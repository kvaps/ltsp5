# The dbus machine id should be unique for each client, otherwise problems may
# occur, e.g. if a thin client has the same id as the server, then `sudo gedit`
# on the client session which runs on the server gives "access denied"!
# It also helps if it's constant, so we generate it from the client MAC
# address. That way we don't pollute e.g. ~/.pulse/* with random entries on
# fat clients.
